Organogenesis in mammals represents one of the most intricate phases of embryonic development, where a simple cluster of cells transforms into fully functional organs through a symphony of precisely coordinated cellular events. This process unfolds across both space and time, involving cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis, all synchronized to sculpt tissues and structures with remarkable accuracy. At the heart of this orchestration lie intricate transcriptional networks that govern gene expression patterns, ensuring that cells adopt the right identities and behaviors at the appropriate moments. Simultaneously, metabolic pathways play a pivotal role, providing the energy, building blocks, and signaling molecules necessary for these cellular transformations. These pathways are not static; they adapt dynamically to the evolving demands of development, influencing everything from cell fate decisions to tissue architecture. However, despite significant advances in developmental biology, the precise mechanisms by which transcriptional regulation and metabolic reprogramming interplay to propel the complexity of morphogenesis remain largely enigmatic. Questions persist about how shifts in metabolic flux might feedback into transcriptional control, or how spatial gradients of metabolites could pattern organ formation.
